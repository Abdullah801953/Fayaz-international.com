                        <p>Medical Council of India (MCI) Screening Test is also known as Foreign Medical Graduates
                            Examination (FMGE). It is a national level licensure examination conducted by the National
                            Board of Examination (NBE) twice a year. This is an important exam for the candidates who
                            have studied medical courses in abroad, i. e., outside India and want to start their career
                            here in India. </p>
                        <p>However, there is another requirement for their smooth practice of medicine in India. They
                            also have to practice an year's internship from a teaching hospital or medical college in
                            India. It must be taken into consideration that the hospital from where the candidate is
                            taking internship in India must be recognized by the Medical Council of India. This
                            internship can be done outside India also. However, the relevant internship certificate must
                            be attested by the Indian Mission Embassy or Consulate office present in that country. </p>
                        <p>The system of Screening Test was introduced in 2002. It is a kind of qualifying examination
                            for the students who pursued their medical degree from the countries outside India. These
                            countries include Soviet Union, Nepal, China, Eastern European countries, Philippines,
                            Caribbean countries, and many more. This Screening test is highly compulsory for the Indian
                            doctors holding any basic medical degree from outside India. However, the medical
                            institution from where you obtained the degree must be listed in the WHO International
                            Directory of Medical Schools.</p>
                        <strong>Note— The students who took admission in abroad on or after 15. 03. 2002 must have to
                            obtain an Eligibility Certificate” from the Medical Council of India. However, this is not
                            required for the Indian students who took admission before 15. 03. 2002. </strong>

                        <p>The UK Clinical Aptitude Test is an admission test used as a selection process and is meant
                            for the medical and dental degree programs. It is also known as University Clinical Aptitude
                            Test. It is used by a consortium of Universities in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and
                            Australia. However, it runs on a collaborative working process of UKCAT Consortium with
                            Pearson VUE. Though UKCAT was introduced in 2006, yet it was kept for test for some years.
                        </p>
                        <p>This test gives the idea about the candidate’s attitudes, mental abilities and possible
                            professional behaviour. The test centres are located worldwide including EU. Andhra Pradesh,
                            Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and New Delhi (Yusuf Sarai) are the centres for UKCAT in
                            India. This test helps the universities to be more particular between the medical and dental
                            applicants. UKCAT is compulsory for UK, EU and majority of international applicants. </p>
                        <p>You are allowed to sit for one time in an year (in one cycle) for the exam. However, in case,
                            if you are unsuccessful in getting admission in the medical school, you have to apply for
                            the UKCAT again for the following year. However, if you fail to appear for the exam within
                            the stipulated time and apply for any program, where this test needed, you will be certainly
                            rejected for that application. Only when you are exempted from the UKCAT, then only there
                            are chances to get allowed for the said application .</p>
                        <p>This exemption is based on geographical terms. Like, if you live in a country where there is
                            no test centres in your country, then you are exempted from this examination. However,
                            before asking for your exemption, make sure that there is no test centres for UKCAT in your
                            country. To apply for exemption, you have to fill the form given in the official portal
                            relevant to exemption. After considering the application, an exemption number is given to
                            the applicants via email for their easy admission in medical schools without appearing in
                            the UKCAT. However, you have to meet all the criteria before applying for the exemption.</p>
                        <p>The UKCAT authorities will inform you about list of medical schools where you can apply. You
                            don’t need to put efforts to search for any medical or dental schools. It is earnestly
                            notified that you are exempted by UKCAT based on the expectations of your ability to perform
                            well in the test. No any other irrelevant grounds will be entertained. Thus, if you feel
                            yourself eligible for exemption, contact the UKCAT authorities directly. </p>

                            pre-assessment International English Language Testing System (IELTS) test. This is designed

                            medical skills and knowledge. The PLAB test consists of two separate assessments, part 1 and
                            part 2. The GMC requires doctors to pass part 1 before they can take part 2 of the test. If
