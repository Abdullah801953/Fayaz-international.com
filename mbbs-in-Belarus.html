                                Belarus is officially known as the Republic of Belarus. Belarus
                                is often referred to as white Russia or White Ruthenia. It is a
                                landlocked country in eastern Europe. Russia borders Belarus to
                                the east and northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the
                                west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. The current
                                president of the country is Alexander Lukashenko. The country
                                has many rare plants and animal species. Belarus is famous for
                                its beauty and greenery. Belarus declared independence on 25
                                August 1991. In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for
                                greater cooperation, forming the Union State. Much of the
                                borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939 when some
                                lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it
                                after the Soviet invasion of Poland and were finalized after
                                World War II. Belarus covers 207,600 square kilometers (80,200
                                sq mi), with a population of 9.4 million, and is the
                                thirteenth-largest and the twentieth-most populous country in
                                Europe. The country is administratively divided into seven
                                regions and is one of the world's most urbanized, with over 40%
                                of its total land area forested. Minsk is Belarus's capital and
                                largest city. Belarus National flag is a red-and-green flag with
                                a white-and-red ornament pattern placed at the hoist end. The
                                current design was introduced in 2012 by the State Committee for
                                Standardisation of the Republic of Belarus and adapted from a
                                design approved in a May 1995 referendum. There is no official
                                interpretation for the colors of the flag but according to an
                                explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red
                                represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation's
                                forefathers, while green represents life. Belarus climate is a
                                temperate-continental climate with moderate features, which is
                                characteristic of Central Europe, with hot summers, long, cold
                                winters, and very distinct seasons. Daytime temperatures vary
                                from -5-0°C in the winter and 25-30°C in the summer months. The
                                country is also famous for its sweets or desserts.

                            <p>
                                Gomel is a city in southeastern Belarus. There are many stories
                                about the origin of the name, but the most famous is that the
                                name is derived from the name of the stream Homeyuk, which
                                flowed into the river Sozh near the hill where the first
                                settlement was founded. Gomel was founded at the end of the 1st
                                millennium AD on the lands of the Eastern Slavic tribal union of
                                Radimichs. It lies on the banks of the Sozh river and the
                                Homeyuk stream. Sozh's high right bank, cut through by canyons,
                                provided a natural fortification. For some time, Gomel was the
                                Gomel Principality's capital, before it became part of the
                                Principality of Chernigov. Gomel is the Gomel Region's
                                administrative center and, with 526,872 inhabitants (2015
                                census),[2] the second-most populous city of Belarus. The
                                coldest month in Gomel, Belarus, is January, with an average
                                high-temperature of -2°C (28.4°F) and an average low-temperature
                                of -6.9°C (19.6°F). The Ferris Wheel and the Ferris Tower,
                                located in a park a few hundred meters from the palace complex,
                                are famous for exploring the city. Since Gomel's topography is
                                relatively flat, the height of the surrounding buildings means
                                it is easy to view the city from the wheel and tower.
